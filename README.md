# @board-bound/workspace

This is a pre-configured workspace, including launch scripts to
automatically rebuild plugins or the server when changes are made.

```

[`@board-bound/example`](https://github.com/board-bound/example)
repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:board-bound/example.git
```

Or create a new plugin from scratch, by copying the
[`@board-bound/example`](https://github.com/board-bound/example)
repository, by clicking
[here](https://github.com/new?template_name=example&template_owner=board-bound)

Run the dev workspace:
