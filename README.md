# @board-bound/workspace

This is a pre-configured workspace, including launch scripts to
automatically rebuild plugins or the server when changes are made.

## Installing and Setting Up the Development Environment

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

On the initial run, this command will also clone the
[`@board-bound/server`](https://github.com/board-bound/server) and
[`@board-bound/sdk`](https://github.com/board-bound/sdk) repositories and install their respective dependencies.

### Step 2: Configure `config.json`

After the first installation, you can modify the `config.json` file to specify which projects should be automatically updated during subsequent `pnpm install` executions. Typically, this includes only the `@board-bound/server` and `@board-bound/sdk` projects.

**Important:** It is strongly recommended to disable automatic updates while making changes to files within any project to avoid unintended overwrites.

### Step 3: Clone or Create a Plugin

Clone any repository based on the
[`@board-bound/example`](https://github.com/board-bound/example)
in to the root of the workspace:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:board-bound/example.git
```

Alternatively, you can create a new plugin from scratch by copying the
[`@board-bound/example`](https://github.com/board-bound/example) repository. Use the provided [template link](https://github.com/new?template_name=example&template_owner=board-bound) to get started.

### Step 4: Enable Development Environment Linking

To enable or disable development environment linking, use:

```bash
# Enable linking
pnpm enable-dev

# Check if dev mode is enabled
pnpm is-dev-enabled

# Disable linking
pnpm disable-dev
```

This feature resolves dependencies within the local workspace and links packages automatically, ensuring that TypeScript correctly resolves imports.

**Note:** After adding a new plugin to the workspace, you must run `pnpm enable-dev` again to link the new plugin.

### Step 5: Start the Development Workspace

Run the development workspace with automatic rebuild functionality:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This setup will monitor changes and rebuild the project automatically.
